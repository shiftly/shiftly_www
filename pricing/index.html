								<p class="question">How does the free trial work?</p>
								<p class="answer">Your free trial begins as soon as you sign up with your Shiftly account. We won't charge you anything for an entire month, and if you cancel your account within that month, nothing will be charged to your credit card.
								</p>
								<p class="question">So I need a credit card to sign up?</p>
								<p class="answer">Of course not! You can happily sign up and use Shiftly for up to 5 staff for as long as you'd like, and we'll never ask you for a credit card.
								</p>
								<p class="question">How do I change plans?</p>
								<p class="answer">Shiftly chooses your plan automatically based on your staff count. Your bill will be charged on the number of staff you have on your billing day. We don't pro rata your staff count (up or down) to keep things simple. If you think something is incorrect, <a href="mailto:support@shiftly.com">let us know</a> and we'll sort it out!
								</p>
								<p class="question">Do I have to sign a long-term contract?</p>
								<p class="answer">No, Shiftly is a monthly subscription. There are no long-term contracts and no commitments. If you decide to cancel your account in the middle of a month, you won't even be charged for that current month!
								</p>

							<div class="questions-inner">
								<p class="question">So the price is per location?</p>
								<p class="answer">Correct. Some users manage multiple rosters for multiple businesses, so our pricing assists with this scenario. If you manage one business/franchise, you'll generally have just one location, so the pricing should be nice and easy.
								</p>
								<p class="question">But how many locations can I create?</p>
								<p class="answer">As many as you'd like! We encourage you to experiment with Shiftly to find the perfect fit for your business, and if you keep your locations to 5 staff or less, you won't be charged a thing.
								</p>
								<p class="question">What type of payments do you accept?</p>
								<p class="answer">We currently accept all major credit cards through your Shiftly account.
