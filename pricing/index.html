				<div class="span6">
					<div class="questions-inner">
						<p class="question">How does the free trial work?</p>
						<p class="answer">Your free trial begins as soon as you put your credit card in your Shiftly account. We won't charge you anything for an entire month, and if you cancel your account within that month, nothing will be charged to your credit card.
						</p>
						<p class="question">So I need a credit card to sign up?</p>
						<p class="answer">Of course not! You can happily sign up and use Shiftly for up to 3 staff for as long as you'd like, and we'll never ask you for a credit card.
						</p>
						<p class="question">How do I change plans?</p>
						<p class="answer">Shiftly chooses your plan automatically based on your staff count, but we make sure to send you an email if your plan changes. If you've changed plans by accident, you have until the end of your billing month to change your staff count to avoid switching plans. If something goes wrong, <a href="mailto:support@shiftly.com">let us know</a> and we'll sort it out!
						</p>
						<p class="question">Do I have to sign a long-term contract?</p>
						<p class="answer">No, Shiftly is a monthly subscription. There are no long-term contracts and no commitments. If you decide to cancel your account in the middle of a month, you won't even be charged for that current month!
						</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="span6">
					<div class="questions-inner">
						<p class="question">So the price is per roster?</p>
						<p class="answer">Correct. Some users manage multiple rosters for multiple businesses, so our pricing assists with this scenario. If you manage one business/franchise, you'll generally have just one roster, so the pricing should be nice and easy.
						</p>
						<p class="question">But how many rosters can I create?</p>
						<p class="answer">As many as you'd like! We encourage you to experiment with Shiftly to find the perfect fit for your business, and if you keep your rosters to 3 staff or less, you won't be charged a thing.
						</p>
						<p class="question">What type of payments do you accept?</p>
						<p class="answer">We currently accept all major credit cards through your Shiftly account.
