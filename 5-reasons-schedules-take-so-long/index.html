                <p class="point">1. You’re using a spreadsheet, or still using paper rosters!</p>
                <p>In 1963, you could get away with doing rosters on paper.<br/>
					In 1983, people probably did schedules on whiteboards.<br/>
					In 1993, you may have even moved to spreadsheets on your fancy new PC.<br/>
					Let face it, it’s 2013 and there’s a better way of rostering your staff.</p>
				<p>It’s called Shiftly, and it’s an awesome online scheduling app for your business.</p>
                <p class="point">2. You either call every staff member to tell them their shifts, or hope they’ve seen the roster posted at work.</p>
                <p>With Shiftly, you schedule your shifts and then click publish. Every scheduled staff member then get’s a custom email with a list of their shifts.</p>
                <p class="point">3. You forget about someones availability and have to reschedule.</p>
                <p>Shiftly manages staff availability so that you’ll automatically be warned if you’re scheduling a staff member for a shift they can’t attend.</p>
                <p class="point">4. You worry that you’ve missed a key role in your schedule.</p>
                <p>If you run a cafe and only schedule 1 person in the kitchen instead of 2, you’re going to have a lot of problems. Shiftly allows you to split your business into groups that help you delegate staff and highlight where you’ve missed any assignments.</p>
                <p class="point">5. You want to give your staff an equal amount of shifts.</p>
                <p>Do you worry that you keep putting on the same team and leaving some staff short-changed? Wouldn’t it be nice to filter your roster by each staff member and see a visual calendar of all their shifts?</p>
				<p>Shiftly does it, and it’s awesome.</p>
