								<h1>What happens if my staff numbers change?</h1>
								<p>Adding and removing staff is as easy as pie! You can move above or below the staff threshold at anytime with out noticing a change in your usage of the App. If on a monthly plan we will charge each month according to the highest number of staff for the previous month. If you are on a yearly rate and exceed the number of staff for your plan, you will need to switch to monthly payments.  </p>
							</article>
							<article>
								<h1>How do yearly work?</h1>
								<p>If you choose to pay for a year in advance you will receive a discount equal to two months usage on that plan - so you only pay for 10 instead of 12! If at anytime on the yearly plan you exceed the number of staff in your threshold you will need switch to monthly payments. If you are likely to go above or below the staff threshold, it is suggested that you pay monthly.</p>
